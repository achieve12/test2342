    "       VARIABLE:-A variable is something that holds a value that may change. In simplest terms, a variable is just a box that you can put stuff in. You can use variables to store all kinds of stuff, but for now, we are just going to look at storing numbers in variables.\n",
    "       STRING:-A string is simply a list of characters in order. A character is anything you can type on the keyboard in one keystroke, like a letter, a number, or a backslash. For example, \"hello\" is a string. It is five characters long â€” h, e, l, l, o.There are three ways you can declare a string in Python: single quotes ('), double quotes (\"), and triple quotes (\"\"\").\n",
